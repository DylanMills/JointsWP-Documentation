<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/responsive-embed.html">Responsive Embeds</a> are an awesome feature found in Foundation that allows for the use of responsive video embeds from websites like YouTube and Vimeo.

Using WordPress, you can simply paste a video link into the visual editor and it will <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">automatically embed</a> the video.

JointsWP will automatically wrap all YouTube and Vimeo embeds with a responsive embed wrapper.
